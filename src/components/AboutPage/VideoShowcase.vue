As a couple with roots outside of Greece, we spent countless hours experimenting with local ingredients and preparing meals for friends and family. When friends from abroad visited us, they expected to taste the typical Greek dishes like moussaka or gyros. Instead, they were delighted by lesser-known traditional recipes, such as Hilopites with octopus and tomato sauce.`,
